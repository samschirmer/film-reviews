# film-reviews

This is a web app built on PHP/SQLite3 that assists with tracking film reviews. 

The app is extremely barebones right now, especially aesthetically. The functionality is also relatively simple, but this will be expanded as development progresses. The crosstab table to match user ratings to film titles DOES work, though it's somewhat hacky. Considering this codebase is about 10 days old at this point, there is a lot of work to do, and a lot of improvements will be made. 

Things on the TODO list include allowing films, tags, and users to be added on the frontend, allowing those newly-created tags to be applied to films, making the whole thing look at least somewhat decent (likely to eventually be housed on a pixelarity.com template), and allow more interaction with tables (mainly sorting) via Javascript/JQuery.
